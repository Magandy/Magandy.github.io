    <td>i completely ignored the picture showing me what the finished product should look like.
Instead, I used the written instructions to figure out what to do.
( THE PICTURES WERE TERRIBLE! )

Me and my friend decided to plug an extra mouse and keyboard into the fuze so that we could both work on the same project at the same time. It worked!</td>

    <td>probably persevering, because the programme i coded was very difficult, and i would have given up if it wasn't already the end of the lesson!</td>

    <td>Do the extra mouse 'nâ€™ keyboard thing again! It worked brilliantly, and allowed me and my friend to do two different things at the same time without being constantly hunched over 1 small machine together.</td>
