Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjpoKLzh73eAhUP3RoKHVDCAfIQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F396246467184165391%2F&psig=AOvVaw3p7nybB0fYOfaq67wsSXmQ&ust=1541500742716932)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
