    <td>the pictures that show you where to put the wires are very bad, so I just guessed the rough positions of the components and then it was just a case of trial-and-error until the circuit worked.</td>

    <td>the terrible photos. We spent half the lesson time trying to reposition the wires so that the circuit worked.</td>
